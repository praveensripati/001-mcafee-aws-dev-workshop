# Topics

    - Create an Application ELB and showcase the path based routing.
    - Register a domain with Freenom and use Route53 to provide a user friendly alternative to the ELB DNS name.
    - Using Cost Explorer to measure and minimize costs
    - Using tags to attribute the costs

# Note

1. Depending on the Internet Service Provider and the Location, the changes to the Freenom and Route53 would take a few minutes to hours for the propagation to take place. If it doesn't work immediately, make sure that all the steps are completed properly and wait for a few hours.

1. Also, the entire lab can be performed for free within in the AWS Free Tier. The Route53 Hosted Zone is charged 50c/HZ/month unless deleted in 12 hours. So, make sure to delete it once done with the lab.

1. Freenom.com is a free service and it is as good as it is. It has been noticed that the service is a bit flaky.

## Create EC2 Instances

1. Create three EC2 instances from the Launch Template and name them as Apparel, Electronics and Default.\

## Install the required softwares on them

1. Connect to all the EC2 instances via Putty and execute the below commands
    - sudo su
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install apache2 -y
    - service apache2 start
    - cd /var/www/html
    - rm index.html

1. On the default EC2 instance execute the following command.
    -  echo "This is the default website" > index.html

1. On the apparel EC2 instance execute the following commands.
    - mkdir apparel
    - cd apparel
    - echo "This is an apparel website" > index.html

1. On the electronics EC2 instance execute the following commands.
    - mkdir electronics
    - cd electronics
    - echo "This is an electronics website" > index.html

1. Make sure that the web pages are accessible using the IP address via the browser.\

## Create an Application Load Balancer with **Path Based Routing**

![](images/2020-11-05-11-42-47.png)

1. In the EC2 Management Console, create three Target Groups (ApparelTG, ElectronicsTG & DefaultTG) with the default options. For each of the above Target Groups add the appropriate EC2 instance as the Target. This can be done by selecting the EC2 instance and clicking on `Include as pending below` button while creating the Target Group.\

1. Go back to the LoadBalancer Screen and create an Application Load Balancer.\
![](images/2020-10-30-16-29-43.png)

1. Give the Load Balancer a name and make sure to select all the Availability Zones. Click on Next.

1. It says `Your load balancer is not using any secure listener`. To avoid this we could have used SSL. For now we will go with non-HTTPS/non-SSL ELB. Click on Next.

1. Check `Select an existing security group` and select the `AllowAll` Security Group. Click on Next.

1. Select `Existing target group` and select the `DefaultTG`. The additional Target Groups can be selected later. Click on Next.

1. For the `Registered Targets`. Click on Next.

1. Review all the details and click on `Review`.

1. Note down the DNS name of the ELB.\

1. In the listeners tab, click on `View/edit rules`.\
![](images/2020-10-31-13-48-33.png)

1. Click on `plus button` to add a rule and click on `Insert Rule`.\
![](images/2020-10-31-13-52-30.png)

1. Create rules for the electronics and apparel website as shown below.\
![](images/2020-10-31-13-55-14.png)

1. Visit the pages as shown below and the appropriate web pages should be displayed. If this works then the path based routing works. Make sure to replace the ELB DNS name.\
