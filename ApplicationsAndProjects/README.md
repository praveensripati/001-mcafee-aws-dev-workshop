# Interesting projects and applications around AWS

AWS does provide a lot of services with very nice and interesting features. But, combining the different AWS Services makes it much more interesting. This page is an attempt to consolidate such things (AWS and non AWS articles). Follow the detailed instructions in each one of them and get more familiar with AWS.

# TODO

1. The above references have to be sorted either from a domain or a service perspective.

1. Add tags to each of the above based on the services used. Would make it easy for someone to find the articles based on services.
